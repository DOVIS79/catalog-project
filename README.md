# Item Catalog Project 
This is my solutions for Item Catalog Project, the third project in Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The purpose of this project was to develope a web application - from scratch - that provides a list of items within a variety of categories and integrate third party user registration and authentication. Authenticated users should have the ability to post, edit, and delete their own items.
## Tools and Frameworks
This web application was built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Vagrant, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Google and Facebook Oauth2.
## Instruction
To run the web application:  
1. Install Vagrant and Virtual Box  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Launch the Vagrant VM (by typing `vagrant up` in the directory */udacity-catalog-project* from the terminal).  
4. From directory */udacity-catalog-project/catalog*, initialize the application database by typing `python database_setup.py` follows by `python feedcatalog.py`.  
5. From directory */udacity-catalog-project/catalog*, run the application within the VM by typing `python main.py` into the Terminal.
